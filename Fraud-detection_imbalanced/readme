This project is based on the following data:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The data are strongly imbalanced.
I tried different strategies for handling imbalanced data, and several different classifiers.
My goal was to minimize the number of false negatives, so my metrics of choice is the recall.
Accuracy wouldn't be a good measure because the minority class is approx. 0.2% of the data.
