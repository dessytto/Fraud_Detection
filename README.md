# MiniSOM_Fraud_Detection
Credit card fraud detection using self-organizing maps



# Self Organizing Map for fraud detection from customers' applications
# Goal: Identify patterns in the high-dim dataset to predict fraud likelyhood
# The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is "Statlog (Aus Credit Approval) Data Set".
# All atribute names have been changed to meaningless symbols for confidentiality, a deep learning algorithm might be helpful.
# Each line is a customer. We want to identify various segments, and the cheaters should stand out as outliers.
# MID: mean interneuron distance. Outliers will be far from the other neurons in their neighborhood.
